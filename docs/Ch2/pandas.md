# 2.1 Pandas in Health Informatics

At the heart of many health informatics projects lies Pandas, a robust library for data analysis:
- **Cleaning and Preprocessing Patient Data**: Pandas aids in tackling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring data's reliability.
- **Time Series Data Analysis**: With time-stamped medical results and vitals, Pandas offers tools to uncover trends and patterns in patient history.
- **Merging Datasets**: Whether it's combining lab results with doctor notes or integrating imaging data, Pandas is up to the task.
