# 5.3 Confidence Intervals in Health Studies

When clinicians or researchers say they are "confident" about a particular result, they're often referring to a confidence interval.

- A *confidence interval* provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. It's especially useful in understanding the results of medical tests and gauging the efficacy of treatments.
- The interplay between *sample size*, *effect size*, and *confidence intervals* is intricate. A large sample might give more accurate results, but if the effect size is small, the clinical significance might still be in question.
