# 7.2 Working with Geospatial Data in Python

The Python ecosystem offers robust tools to work with geospatial data, particularly for health analytics.

- [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) stands out as an invaluable tool. This library enables seamless integration of spatial data with traditional health datasets.
- Geocoding patient addresses can provide spatial context to health trends. Once this data is geocoded, it can be visualized, analyzed, and integrated with other datasets.
