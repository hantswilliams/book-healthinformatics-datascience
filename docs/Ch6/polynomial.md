# 6.4 Polynomial Regression in Health Informatics

Not all relationships are linear, and polynomial regression helps capture these nuances.

- Some health relationships are curved or have peaks and valleys. Polynomial regression can model these non-linear patterns, such as the relationship between drug dosage and its effect.
- But with increased complexity comes the risk of *overfitting*. An overfit model might predict the training data very well but fail on new, unseen data.
