# 9.1 Bagging and Boosting in Clinical Models

While individual models can provide valuable insights, combining several models can often enhance prediction accuracy and robustness.

- **Bootstrapping** is a resampling technique that allows the creation of multiple datasets from one original dataset. When combined with **bagging** (Bootstrap AGGregatING), it can significantly improve the stability and accuracy of predictions, especially in the volatile realm of health data.
- **Boosting**, on the other hand, focuses on sequentially improving the predictions of weak learners, thereby reducing bias in health data models. Each subsequent model compensates for the areas where the preceding models performed poorly, creating an aggregate model with enhanced predictive power.
