# 9.3 Gradient Boosted Trees in Disease Prognosis

Gradient Boosted Trees are a powerful ensemble technique that builds trees sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of its predecessor.

- This method is particularly potent in predicting disease progression and mapping patient trajectories, providing a holistic view of a patient's potential health journey.

- Given the nature of some diseases being rarer than others, many health datasets exhibit class imbalances. Gradient Boosted Trees can be tailored to handle such imbalanced datasets, ensuring rare disease predictions are not overshadowed by more common conditions.

The introduction of ensemble methods in predictive health analytics signifies the evolution of the field. As healthcare professionals seek ever more precise and reliable predictions, ensemble methods stand out as a promising avenue to explore.
