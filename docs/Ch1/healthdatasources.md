# 1.1 Health Data Sources

With the proliferation of digital health platforms, a plethora of data sources have emerged:

- **Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Personal Health Records (PHRs)**: These digital versions of paper patient charts contain comprehensive patient health histories and are central to modern healthcare.
- **Bioinformatics Data**: The '-omics' era, including genomics and proteomics, has ushered in vast datasets that hold clues to our biological functioning and susceptibility to diseases.
- **Sensor Data**: With wearable health monitors and medical devices, continuous data streams offer insights into patient health in real-time.
- **Web Data**: Digital footprints from health forums, patient portals, and telemedicine logs can offer a unique perspective on patient behavior and needs.
