# 8.3 Naive Bayes for Diagnostic Tests

The Naive Bayes algorithm, rooted in Bayes' theorem, provides a probabilistic framework for diagnostic testing.

- In the context of healthcare, understanding Bayes' theorem helps in predicting the probability of a disease given specific test results and prior information.
- The 'naive' assumption, considering each predictor to be independent, can often be a limitation but still provides useful insights in many clinical scenarios.
