# 3.7 Introduction to Medical Imaging EDA

Medical images, like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, provide a wealth of data.

- Analyzing these images is a blend of domain-specific knowledge and technical expertise. Patterns within these images can reveal everything from bone fractures to the presence of tumors, underlining their significance in health informatics.

Armed with insights from EDA, health informaticians are better equipped to delve deeper, driving patient care and advancing medical research. The subsequent chapters will further unravel the potential of data-driven decision-making in healthcare.
