# 10.1 Clustering Techniques in Patient Segmentation

Patient segmentation enables healthcare providers to offer more personalized and efficient care by grouping patients based on specific metrics or conditions.

- **K-means clustering** is a popular method that divides patients into a pre-defined number of groups based on their health metrics, providing insights into patient subgroups.
- **Hierarchical clustering** takes a nested approach, producing a tree of clusters. This method provides a nuanced understanding of how patients relate to one another, enabling more fine-tuned care strategies.

**Case Study**: Leveraging these techniques, healthcare systems can stratify patients to offer personalized care pathways, improving patient outcomes and system efficiency.
