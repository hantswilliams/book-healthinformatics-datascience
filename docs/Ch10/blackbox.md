# 10.4 Interpreting the "Black Box" for Clinicians

As machine learning models become increasingly sophisticated, their complexity often makes them seem like a "black box", especially to clinicians who rely on their predictions.

- Recognizing the crucial importance of model transparency in healthcare, we introduce **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**. SHAP values provide a unified measure of feature importance and allow for the explanation of individual predictions.
- **SHAP plots** offer a visual means to understand how each feature impacts model predictions, fostering trust among clinicians using AI diagnostic tools.

**Case Study**: Diagnostic AI tools, armed with interpretable machine learning methods, enhance clinical decision-making by providing not just predictions but also the rationale behind those predictions.
