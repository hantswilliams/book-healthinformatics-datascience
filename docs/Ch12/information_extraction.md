# 12.4 Information Extraction from Clinical Narratives

Clinical narratives are rich with named entities like drugs, diseases, symptoms, and more. Extracting this information can be a linchpin for many clinical applications.

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Tools such as MedSpacy and ScispaCy excel in extracting medical entities from texts.
- **Relationships Extraction**: Understanding relationships, such as drug-disease associations or symptom-condition links, can provide foundational knowledge for diagnosis or treatment suggestions.
