# 4.6 Medical Imaging Visualization

Beyond numerical data, visualization plays a pivotal role in medical imaging.

- While traditional tools dominate medical imaging, libraries like Seaborn and Plotly can provide supplementary visual aids, enhancing the depth of imaging analyses.

Data visualization in health informatics does more than simplify data; it tells a story, uncovers insights, and provides direction for both clinicians and researchers. With tools like Seaborn and Plotly, this task becomes both simpler and more effective.
