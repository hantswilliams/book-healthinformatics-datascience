# 4.2 Basic Plotting Techniques with Seaborn in a Health Context

Seaborn, a Python library built on top of Matplotlib, offers a variety of plotting styles that can be tailored to health data.

- *Histograms*, *box plots*, and *swarm plots* are perfect tools to visualize the distribution of patient data, be it vitals, medical test results, or symptoms.
- To display trends over time, such as patient recovery rates or the effectiveness of a new medication, *line* and *scatter plots* are particularly valuable.
- When dealing with multiple health parameters, *heatmaps* can be used to effectively display correlations.
